This Simulink model implements a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for loan approval based on inputs such as credit score, monthly income, loan amount requested, and existing debt.

How to Open the File:
1. Ensure MATLAB is Installed:
   You need MATLAB with Simulink and the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox installed.
2. Sign In to MATLAB Online (If Not Using Desktop MATLAB):
   Go to MathWorks MATLAB Online.
   Sign in with your MathWorks account.
3. Open the SLX File:
   Click "Upload" and select the .slx file from your device.
   Once uploaded, double-click the file to open it in Simulink.
4. Run the Model:
    Click the Run button in Simulink to simulate the loan approval process.

Notes:
This model uses a Mamdani-type FIS named Loan_Approval.fis. 
Ensure the .fis file is in the same directory as the .slx file.
You can modify input values using Constant Blocks in Simulink.
The Fuzzy Logic Controller processes the inputs and provides a loan approval probability (%) as output.
